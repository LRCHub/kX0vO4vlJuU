Get in to my system,
Euphoria Euphoria Euphoria

Dance with the lizard
Funk that monkey to the ground
Shake till you blister war party hound
Ta tongue twister I'm so addicted to your high
Said the serpent withdraw
You'll lose your mind

No no no, I don't need no doctor
No 911 nurse in white
No mercy love shock circe in flight
No euthanasia hallucination fill my mind
I chase the dragon,
Our brave new worlds collide

Get into my system... Euphoria
Get into my system... inject me in
Get into my system
Sweet tender drug
Get into my system
Let me feel the gods make
Let me feel the gods make love

Like metal to the metal
Frictions gonna start a fire
No serum in the kettle
Suffocating in the myre
Take this lickin' stick ooh babe
Meltdown begins
Snake it under my skin

Get into my system... Euphoria
Get into my system... inject me in
Get into my system
Sweet tender drug
Get into my system
Let me feel the gods make
Let me feel the gods make!@#$%
Infatuation
Emergency code blue
I just can't get over
I just can't get over you
